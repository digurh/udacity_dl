    "* Modify `train`:\n",
    ">* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`. This will help with the next step.\n",
    ">* At the beginning of the function, you'll want to preprocess your reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review. This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1. Your code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer`\n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.\n",
    ">* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.\n",
    "* Modify `run`:\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer` \n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
